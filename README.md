## Overview
This repository consists of minor C++ Project which I made during learning C++.

## Minor Project List
1) Student Management System - It is a fun project to understand, In general how management system works.
2) Inventory - It is a General Quantity Based Measurement console based software which teach me how to develop a software in layered programing approach.
3) Replica Of STL - It is also a fun project to understand the importance of virtual polymorphism and how it is implemented in predefined library/classes.
4) tmcommon - It is just string utility project.
5) TMDate - It is a kind of replica of Date class which present in Java, hence Traditional C++ won't provide anything related to Date.
6) SQlite3 - RDMBS for c++ projects.
